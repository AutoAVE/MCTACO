# MC-TACO 🌮
Dataset and code for “Going on a vacation” takes longer than “Going for a walk”: A Study of Temporal Commonsense Understanding, EMNLP 19

## Dataset
We provide the dev/test split as specified in the paper, along with a detailed readme.txt file under `data/`

## Experiments (WIP)
At this point, we provide the outputs of the ESIM/BERT baselines. 

In progress: we will release the code to run the baselines after some cleaning.
